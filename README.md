- Requires Windows 11
- Keybind must be selected before hitting the built-in start button (it intentionally blocks attemps to change the keybind once its running)
- After pressing one of the buttons to change the keybind, press a key on your keyboard. This only works for non-extended keyboard keys. No numpads or additional buttons, for instance
- Windows defender will complain about it. the code's all there, I promise it's not a virus.
